# pco_simple_gui
This is a simple Matlab GUI for getting images from PCO.edge camera. You can set the exposure time. My code for GUI is [my_pco_gui.m](https://github.com/ksonod/pco_simple_gui/blob/master/my_PCO/my_pco_gui.m). Other codes are taken from an official package for getting images from the camera ([link](https://www.pco.de/software/third-party-software/)). This package is provided by the company.
