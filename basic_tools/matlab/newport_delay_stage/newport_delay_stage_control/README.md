## Description
This repository contains simple Matlab codes for controlling [Newport delay line stage](https://www.newport.com/f/delay-line-stages). You can start from here and modify them. In order to control the stage, .NET Framework is used. These codes work under the following condisionts:
- Windows 10
- Matlab R2018b
- [DL Series Optical Delay Line Linear Motor Linear Translation Stages](https://www.newport.com/f/delay-line-stages)

## DLS_1_get_version
You can get the version of your delay line stage.  

## DLS_2_get_current_position
You can get the current position of your delay line stage.  

## DLS_3_move_stage
You can move your delay line stage.
