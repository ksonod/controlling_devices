# Other GUI, codes, and softwares
The following list includes other GUI, codes, and softwares for controlling devices and getting images from a camera. Some of them are very simple, so you can easilly modify them.

## Matlab
- [newport_delay_stage_gui_matlab](https://github.com/ksonod/newport_delay_stage_gui_matlab): Matlab version of [newport_delay_stage_gui](https://github.com/ksonod/newport_delay_stage_gui).
- [delayscan_images](https://github.com/ksonod/delayscan_images): This is basically the same as [image_delay_gui](https://github.com/ksonod/image_delay_gui), but no GUI is available. 
- [newport_delay_stage_basic_matlab](https://github.com/ksonod/newport_delay_stage_basic_matlab): This repository contains very simple Matlab codes for controlling the newport delay stage.
- [thorlabs_camera_simple_matlab](https://github.com/ksonod/thorlabs_camera_simple_matlab): This repository shows a simple way of how to get images from a [Thorlabs camera](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=4024) using Matlab.
- [pco_simple_gui](https://github.com/ksonod/pco_simple_gui): This simple GUI tool shows how to get images from a [PCO.edge camera](https://www.pco.de/)
- [sc10_optical_shutter_simple_matlab](https://github.com/ksonod/sc10_optical_shutter_simple_matlab): This is a simple Matlab code for controlling the [optical shutters](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=927) using sc10 controller.
- [webcam_video_image](https://github.com/ksonod/webcam_video_image): This is a simple Matlab code for displaying a video recorded by a USB camera.

## Python
- [newport_delay_stage_basic_python](https://github.com/ksonod/newport_delay_stage_basic_python): This repository shows a simple way of how to move the [Newport delay line stage](https://www.newport.com/f/delay-line-stages).
